## Object Detection in images and videos

## Project presentation :

This project for object to detect 80 object using for a selected image or video . So to develop this project we are used the following working tools:

### Working Tools :
   
#####     Yolo Algorithm :
   
          YOLO is an abbreviation for the term ‘You Only Look Once’. This is an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects in a picture (in real-time).
          Object detection in YOLO is done as a regression problem and provides the class probabilities of thedetected images.
          YOLO algorithm employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect objects in realtime. As the name suggests, the algorithm requires only a single 
          forward propagation through a neural network to detect objects.
          This means that prediction in the entire image is done in a single algorithm run. The CNN is used to predict various class probabilities and bounding
          boxes  simultaneously.
          
####      OpenCv : 
          
          OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an  open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like
          face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection
          
####      Numpy :
          
          NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee 
          efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on 
          these arrays and matrices.
          
####     Imutils

          A series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, displaying
          Matplotlib images, sorting contours, detecting edges, and much more easier with OpenCV and both Python 2.7 and Python 3.
          
####      Argparse :
          Allows the use of positional arguments. Allows the customization of the prefix chars. Supports variable numbers of parameters for a single option.
          Supports subcommands (A main command line parser can use other command line parsers depending on some arguments).
